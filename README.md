# GenAI Risk & Compliance Assistant

A multi-agent GenAI solution for financial compliance, risk analytics, and AI-powered Q&A‚Äîbuilt natively on Snowflake with a modern Streamlit dashboard.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to combine advanced data engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate complex compliance and risk workflows on real SEC financial data. Inspired by the GenAI strategies of leading financial institutions, it showcases:

- **Automated compliance checks** and risk flagging
- **RAG-powered, context-rich Q&A** using Snowflake Cortex LLMs
- **Executive-ready summaries** of company filings
- **Interactive analytics dashboard** for business and technical users
- **Enterprise-grade security and auditability**

---

## Architecture

- **Data Layer:** SEC XBRL tables (`NUM`, `PRE`, `SUB`, `TAG`) and aggregated views (e.g., `COMPANY_CHUNKS_PROD`)
- **AI/ML Layer:** Snowflake Cortex for LLM-based summarization, semantic search, and RAG Q&A
- **Application Layer:** Streamlit app with multi-agent logic (compliance, risk, summarization) and analytics
- **Security:** All access and actions are managed by Snowflake roles and logging

For a detailed system diagram and data flow, see [`Docs/architecture.md`](Docs/architecture.md).
