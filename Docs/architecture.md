# GenAI Risk & Compliance Assistant — System Architecture

## Overview
This is a fully automated, Snowflake-native GenAI application for financial compliance, risk analytics, and AI-powered Q&A on SEC data. The system orchestrates multi-agent logic, RAG pipelines, and interactive dashboards—all with enterprise-grade security, auditability, and scalability.

## Components

### 1. Data Engineering & Automation Layer (Snowflake)
- **Raw SEC Tables:** `NUM`, `PRE`, `SUB`, `TAG` auto-ingested via Snowpipe.
- **Streams:** Track new/changed data for incremental, event-driven processing.
- **Tasks:** Trigger SQL transformations and AI enrichment (chunking, embedding) automatically[2][4][6].
- **Aggregated & Agent Views:** 
  - `COMPANY_CHUNKS_PROD` (key metrics per filing)
  - `NON_COMPLIANT_FILINGS`, `HIGH_RISK_FILINGS`, `FILING_SUMMARIES` (business logic for agents)
- **RAG Chunks:** `DOC_CHUNKS` table with AI-generated text and vector embeddings for semantic retrieval[3].

### 2. AI/ML & Retrieval Layer
- **Snowflake Cortex LLM:** Native LLM for summarization, Q&A, and embedding generation.
- **Vector Search:** Semantic retrieval using `VECTOR_COSINE_SIMILARITY` and Cortex embeddings.
- **RAG Pipeline:** Embeds user queries, retrieves relevant context chunks, and generates grounded answers.

### 3. Application & Analytics Layer (Streamlit)
- **Automated File Upload:** Users upload SEC files; ingestion and processing are fully automated.
- **Compliance Agent Tab:** Flags missing or non-compliant filings in real time.
- **Risk Agent Tab:** Highlights financial anomalies as soon as data arrives.
- **AI Summaries Tab:** LLM-generated, audit-ready summaries for each filing.
- **Data Analytics Tab:** Interactive charts, trends, and anomaly detection.
- **RAG Q&A Expander:** Open-ended, context-rich Q&A powered by RAG and LLMs.
- **Monitoring Tab:** Live status of Snowpipes, tasks, and table row counts for pipeline observability.

### 4. Security, Governance & Auditability
- **Access Control:** All access managed with Snowflake roles and privileges.
- **Audit Logging:** Every query and AI action is logged and auditable in Snowflake.
- **Data Lineage:** All transformations and AI steps are reproducible and traceable.

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion:** SEC files are uploaded and auto-loaded into raw tables via Snowpipe.
2. **Change Capture:** Streams detect new data and trigger downstream processing.
3. **Automated Transformation:** Tasks process streams, aggregate key metrics, and create agent views and RAG chunks.
4. **AI Enrichment:** Tasks generate embeddings and summaries using Cortex LLM.
5. **User Interaction:** Streamlit app provides analytics, agent alerts, and RAG-powered Q&A, all in real time.
6. **Monitoring & Observability:** Dashboards show pipeline health, task status, and data freshness.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Snowflake-Native Everything:** All ingestion, transformation, AI, and analytics run within Snowflake for maximum security, scalability, and auditability.
- **Event-Driven Automation:** Streams and tasks ensure every new file is processed and enriched automatically—no manual SQL needed after setup.
- **Modular, Extensible SQL & AI:** Easily add new agents, metrics, or data sources.
- **Explainable, Trustworthy AI:** Every insight is grounded in governed, auditable data.

---

## Extensibility

- **Add More Agents:** e.g., fraud detection, ESG compliance, regulatory change monitoring.
- **Integrate New Data Sources:** Internal policies, regulatory bulletins, or third-party feeds.
- **Deploy Externally:** Streamlit Community Cloud or other platforms, using Snowflake connectors.
- **Plug in Advanced AI:** Integrate with LangChain, external LLMs, or custom AI workflows as needed.
